Fractals is a personal project by Andres Urquijo.

It is a study in the usage of replicating shapes to represent 
plant-like objects. A replication algorithm is used to generate 
the objects procedurally. A stochastic variance is added to make 
each object unique. Although clone to unique objects instances 
can be added for an improved performance to plant quantity ratio.
A few seed parameters can be specified to customize the plants 
general shape, eg. amount of leaves.
